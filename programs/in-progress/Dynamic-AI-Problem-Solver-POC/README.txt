You'll need an OPENAI key with credit on it to use this demo unfortunately, but it should use minimal credit. This is a demo I created as a prototype for a dynamic program controller that can access existing functions to solve a problem or alternatively create solutions from scratch using ChatGPT as a framework when given the problem to solve in words.

The wake word can be set to anything, and the trigger words can be modified as needed.
